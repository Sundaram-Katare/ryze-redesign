## 🧠 DESIGN EXPLANATION

> I approached the redesign by prioritizing clarity and structure over visual density.  
> The original site communicates strong ideas but presents many elements simultaneously, which can overwhelm first-time users.
>
> In this redesign, I focused on clear messaging, modular sections, and intentional whitespace to help users quickly understand Ryze’s value proposition.  
> Subtle animations were added to guide attention and improve the overall experience without distracting from the content.
>
> The UI is built using reusable components to ensure scalability and easy updates in the future, while maintaining full responsiveness across devices.
